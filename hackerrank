Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Select Distinct City from Station where lower(substr(city,1,1) in ('a','e','i','o','u'))

Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

  Select distinct city from station where City like '%a' or city like '%e' or
city like '%i' or city like '%o' or city like '%u';

Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

  SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE SUBSTRING(CITY,1,1) in('A','E','I','O','U') AND SUBSTRING(REVERSE(CITY),1,1) in('A','E','I','O','U');

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

  Select distinct city from station where lower(substr(city,1,1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

  Select distinct city from station where lower(substr(reverse(city),1,1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

  Select distinct city from station where lower(substr(city,1,1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u') or lower(substr(reverse(city),1,1)) not in ('a','i','o','e','u');

Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

  Select distinct city from station where lower(substr(city,1,1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u') and lower(substr(reverse(city),1,1)) not in ('a','e','i','o','u');

Consider  and  to be two points on a 2D plane where  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude (LAT_N) and  are the respective minimum and maximum values of Western Longitude (LONG_W) in STATION.

Query the Euclidean Distance between points  and  and format your answer to display  decimal digits.


Select round(sqrt(power(max(LAT_N)-MIN(LAT_N),2)+power(MAX(LONG_W)-MIN(LONG_W),2)),4) from station;
